My python solutions to two of the qualification round questions for the 2013 Google Code Jam (more than enough to get past the first round).

The solution for 'a' works for all input sizes

The solution for 'c' works for the small and medium input sizes, but cannot create a list of palindromic squares fast enough for numbers up to 10^100, as required for the large input.

The other questions were not attempted (these solutions gave me more than enough points to move to the next round).
